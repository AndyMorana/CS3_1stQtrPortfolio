# Topics I Know Well

1. **Basic Syntax**
   I know how to make sure that my code has the correct syntax, as shown by how I always instinctively place semicolons at the end of most lines. Recognizing these important fundamental rules is the key for me to not immediately mess up my code.

2. **Variable Declaration**
   I understand how to declare variables using let and const so that I can store data for later on. I also acknowledge the different data types I can use in declaring my variables such as strings, numbers and booleans.

3. **Operations**
   Due to our previous lessons on C++, I can easily comprehend each of the symbols for the different arithmetic operands. Thus, I am able to effectively use of them in my code if I need to add, subtract, multiply or divide variables and numbers.

4. **If/Else Statements**
   I have a solid grasp on if, else if, and else statements, because of my past knowledge on C++. These conditionals helped me a lot in taking different paths and making decisions, while executing my code based on the criteria I gave.

5. **While Loops**
   I am comfortable with using these kinds of loops to repeat actions. They understand how loops can automate repetitive tasks and traverse through data. For me, while loops are crucial whensimilar actions have to be performed multiple times.

# Topics Where I Need Further Practice/Discussion

1. **Functions**
    I still haven't fully grasped how to write functions correctly, especially when it comes to returning a certain value. This is due to the fact that I consistently place all of my code in my main block of code, even if it is obvious that it would be a lot easier to use functions instead.

2. **I/O Statements**
   I still don't know much about making input statements, despite being great at utilizing output statements like console.log. Usually, the required input statements would already be there in the sample code template so there was basically no point in creating one.

3. **For Loops**
   Even though they are supposedly easier to use than while loops, I still don't fully understand how to construct for loops. Properly setting the number of repetitions needed definitely consumes a lot of my time.

4. **Switch Statements**
   I don't use switch statements that often compared to the other conditional statements, since they are harder to master. Because of their complexity, I prefer utilizing if/else statements in my code instead. 

5. **Code Debugging**
   I find it quite difficult to figure out the errors in my code, especially if it is long and complex. Debugging basically becomes trial and error until something works, which is not a very efficient solution.

# My Plan To Help Myself Understand These Topics Better

1. **Functions**
   I will make separate functions for doing certain things in my code instead of inserting it all in the main block of code. This way, I can properly learn how to write and call functions if necessary.

2. **I/O Statements**
   Through creating multiple programs that will take the user's input, I can practice making input statements. This will help me become way better at utilizing input statements within my code.

3. **For Loops**
   Rather than using while loops, I will use for loops whenever I need to repeat a certain part of my code. With a lot of application, I can comfortably get used to using for loops appropriately.

4. **Switch Statements**
   As an alternative to if/else statements, I will use switch statements to carry out the parts of my code where I need conditional statements. Through this method, I will be capable of implementing switch statements more often than not in my code.

5. **Code Debugging**
   I will master multiple techniques in debugging, so that it can be less of a hassle when it comes to fixing the errors in my code. By doing so, I will also be able to save time and effort in such matters.

# Effective and Ineffective Activities

1. **Guess The Word**
   This activity helped me learn how to implement both conditions and repetitions into one whole code. Not only that, but it was also very interactive and engaging to make the website.

2. **Long Test 1 Coding Part**
   The coding part of the first long test was a great yet simple challenge that helped me apply many conditional statements. It was quite fun just repeatedly putting if else statements for all the different cases.

1. **CodeChef Practice**
   I feel like this activity was a bit unneccesary and unrelated, regardless of the fact that it helped me relearn C++. Although they have their fair share of similarities, C++ and Javascript are very much different from one another.

2. **Long Test 2 Coding Part**
   The coding part of the second long test was very difficult, and I didn't really learn anything from it. It had me constantly changing parts of my code and running it over and over again in vain.
